### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```<div class="second-body"> <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr code image">
    <p>
    <h1 class="one-section">Improve your front-end <br /> skills by building projects</h1>
    <div class="two-section"><br />
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend <br /> Mentor and take your coding skills to <br />the next level</div>
    </p>
```css
.proud-of-this-css 
  body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  font-size: 15px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: calc(100vh- 1px);
  margin: 1.25rem;
}



### Continued development
I hope to continue upgrading my css development skills especially positioning and colour arrangement. 
I also will work on my javascript skills.
